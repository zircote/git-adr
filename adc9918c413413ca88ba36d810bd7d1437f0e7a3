# Coverage Target 95% (Late Addition)

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: PR Requirements
**Type**: Scope Creep

### Context

Original REQUIREMENTS.md specified 90% test coverage. The PR CI configuration required 95%.

### Decision

Raise coverage target from 90% to 95% and add tests to meet it.

### Implementation

- Added `tests/test_completion.py` (12 tests) for shell completion code
- Added `tests/test_rm_command.py` (14 tests) for new rm command
- Final coverage: 95.19%

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Higher code quality assurance
- Better coverage of edge cases
- Shell completion code now tested

**Negative:**
- Additional test development time
- Coverage requirement more strict than planned

### Classification

This is **acceptable scope creep** because:
1. Higher quality is always beneficial
2. CI already enforced this requirement
3. Tests caught real issues during development
