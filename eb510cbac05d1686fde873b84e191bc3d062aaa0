# AI provider priority order

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: User

### Context

Multiple AI providers are supported. Need to prioritize implementation and testing.

### Decision

Priority order: OpenAI → Anthropic → Other providers → Ollama

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- OpenAI has largest user base, gets most attention
- Anthropic as strong secondary option
- Ollama last (local use, no API key needed)

**Neutral:**
- All providers supported via langchain abstraction
