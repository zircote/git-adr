# AI draft uses interactive elicitation by default

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: User

### Context

`git adr draft` needs to help users create ADRs with AI assistance. Two modes are possible:
1. **Batch**: AI generates from commits/context in one shot
2. **Interactive**: AI guides user through Socratic questioning

### Decision

When AI is enabled, `git adr draft` defaults to **interactive elicitation mode**.

The AI asks sequential questions:
1. "What problem are you solving?"
2. "What options have you considered?"
3. "What's driving this decision?"
4. "What are the trade-offs/consequences?"

Then synthesizes answers into a complete ADR.

`--batch` flag available for scripted/automated usage.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- AI acts as collaborative partner, not just generator
- Ensures users think through all decision aspects
- Higher quality ADRs through guided reflection
- Natural for users unfamiliar with ADR structure

**Negative:**
- More complex implementation (conversation state)
- Slower than one-shot generation
- Requires terminal interactivity (not pure stdin/stdout)
