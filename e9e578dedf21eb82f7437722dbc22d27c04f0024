# Use typer for CLI framework

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: User

### Context

The existing skeleton uses click. The product brief suggested typer.

### Decision

Migrate from click to typer.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Type hints provide better IDE support
- Automatic shell completion generation
- Built-in rich integration for formatting
- Less boilerplate than click
- Built on click (same underlying engine)

**Negative:**
- Migration effort from existing click code
- Additional dependency (though click is a transitive dep)
