# Add `git adr rm` command (Late Addition)

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: User
**Type**: Scope Creep

### Context

During implementation, the user needed to remove an ADR from git notes. The original specification (REQUIREMENTS.md) did not include a `rm` command - only artifact removal (`artifact-rm`) was planned.

### Decision

Add `git adr rm <id> [--force]` command to remove ADRs from git notes.

### Implementation

- Interactive confirmation by default showing ADR title, status, and warnings
- `--force` flag to skip confirmation (for scripting)
- Warnings displayed for:
  - ADRs with linked commits (traceability will be lost)
  - ADRs that supersede others (chain will be broken)
  - ADRs superseded by others (reference becomes stale)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Users can remove ADRs without direct git notes manipulation
- Consistent UX with other ADR management commands
- Safe defaults (confirmation required)

**Negative:**
- Scope increase (~5 hours of work including tests and docs)
- Not recoverable without git reflog knowledge

### Classification

This is **acceptable scope creep** because:
1. Aligns with tool's philosophy (manage ADRs without raw git notes)
2. User-requested based on real need
3. Similar pattern to existing `artifact-rm` command
