summary: Merge strategy for template-polluted files

Merge strategy for template-polluted files
## Summary
Files contain `{{package_name}}` template placeholders from a Python project skeleton. Must revert/fix to preserve git-adr functionality.

## Rationale
- `pyproject.toml`: Template would break the build entirely - REVERT
- `.gitignore`: New patterns are mostly duplicates or inappropriate (e.g., ignoring `uv.lock`)
- Issue templates: Fix placeholders, keep as `.yml` forms are better UX than existing `.md`
- Pre-commit: Trim to Python-only hooks (remove Go, JS, Docker, Terraform)
- Gitleaks: Keep, rename to `.gitleaks.toml` to match pre-commit config reference
