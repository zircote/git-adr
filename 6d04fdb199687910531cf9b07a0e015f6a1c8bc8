Merged template-polluted files preserving git-adr functionality
## Summary
Successfully merged working directory changes, prioritizing committed history while retaining new capabilities that don't break existing functionality.

## Changes Made
- **pyproject.toml**: Reverted to committed version (template had `{{package_name}}` breaking placeholders)
- **.gitignore**: Reverted + added useful security patterns (`.secrets/`, `.secrets.baseline`, type checker caches)
- **bug_report.yml**: Fixed placeholders → `git_adr`, added `git-adr --version` hint
- **feature_request.yml**: Fixed placeholders → `git_adr`, added CLI example
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Trimmed from 240→143 lines (removed Go, JS, Docker, Terraform hooks; kept Python, security, markdown)
- **gitleaks.toml**: Renamed to `.gitleaks.toml` to match pre-commit config reference
