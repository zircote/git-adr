# git-lfs Style Distribution (Late Addition)

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: User
**Type**: Scope Creep

### Context

Original spec assumed PyPI-only distribution. User requested distribution patterns following git-lfs conventions for git extensions.

### Decision

Implement git-lfs style distribution with:
- Makefile for build/install/release targets
- install.sh script for tarball installation
- release.yml GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases

### Implementation

- `Makefile` with targets: build, install, install-bin, install-man, install-completions, release
- `script/install.sh` following git-lfs pattern with uv/pip fallback
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` creating tarballs with man pages + completions

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Familiar pattern for git extension users
- Single tarball contains all artifacts
- Works without PyPI access

**Negative:**
- Significant scope increase (~10 hours of work)
- More complex release process

### Classification

This is **acceptable scope creep** because:
1. Follows established git extension conventions
2. Improves distribution flexibility
3. User explicitly requested
