# Attach ADRs to root tree object, not specific commits

**Date**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: User, Claude (Planning)

### Context

Git notes can be attached to any git object. ADRs need a stable attachment point that survives rebase and amendment operations.

### Decision

Attach ADRs to the repository root tree object, with related commit SHAs stored in ADR metadata.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ADRs survive rebase/amend operations
- ADRs exist independently of specific commits
- Supports ADRs that precede or span multiple commits
- Bidirectional tracking via metadata

**Negative:**
- Requires index to map ADR IDs to notes
- Slightly more complex lookup

**Neutral:**
- Related commits tracked in `linked-commits` metadata field
